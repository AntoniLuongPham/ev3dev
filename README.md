The ev3dev meta repo
====================

This repository doesn't actually have any code. It hosts [downloads](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/releases) and the project-wide  [issues](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/issues) tracker.

### Looking for documentation and tutorials? Check out our [website](http://www.ev3dev.org).

Our website hosts docs, guides and tutorials to help you get up-and-running with ev3dev as quickly as possible. Check out the [getting started guide](http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/) if you're looking for a place to jump in.

### Searching for code? Have a look at all of the other repositories in the [ev3dev GitHub organization](https://github.com/ev3dev).

This repo just hosts the "meta content" that spans our many codebases and subprojecs. The code itself is managed granularly on a per-project level, and each gets its own repo.

**Central code repositories:**
- [ev3dev kernel](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3-kernel): The foundational Linux-based kernel that runs ev3dev.
- [LEGO device drivers](https://github.com/ev3dev/lego-linux-drivers): Drivers that provide control over LEGO MINDSTORMS devices and related hardware.
- [Brickman](https://github.com/ev3dev/brickman): Graphical brick manager for ev3dev.
- [ev3dev website](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev.github.io): The ev3dev website and documentation.
