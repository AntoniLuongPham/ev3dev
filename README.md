The ev3dev meta repo
====================

This repository doesn't actually have any code. It hosts [downloads](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/releases) and the project-wide  [issues](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev/issues) tracker.

### Looking for documentation and tutorials? Check out our [website](http://www.ev3dev.org).

Our website hosts docs, guides and tutorials to help you get up-and-running with ev3dev as quickly as possible. Check out the [getting started guide](http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/) if you're looking for a place to jump in.

### Want to get started writing your own programs? Look through the [list of available libraries](http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/libraries/).

We have many contributors that maintain libraries to make it as easy as possible to interface with ev3dev from your code. There's a [centralized repo](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev-lang) with a "unified" library set as well as an overall [list of available libraries](http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/libraries/). Just pick a language, find the corresponding library, and dive into that library's examples. Or, you can always access the drivers directly if your language isn't already implemented as a pre-made library; there's  information on this style on our [docs landing page](http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/).

### Searching for code? Have a look at all of the other repositories in the [ev3dev GitHub organization](https://github.com/ev3dev).

This repo just hosts the "meta content" that spans our many codebases and subprojecs. The code itself is managed granularly on a per-project level, and each gets its own repo.

**Central code repositories:**
- [ev3dev kernel](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3-kernel): The foundational Linux-based kernel that runs ev3dev.
- [LEGO device drivers](https://github.com/ev3dev/lego-linux-drivers): Drivers that provide control over LEGO MINDSTORMS devices and related hardware.
- [Brickman](https://github.com/ev3dev/brickman): Graphical brick manager for ev3dev.
- [ev3dev website](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev.github.io): The ev3dev website and documentation.
- [ev3dev-lang language bindings](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev-lang): A centralized collection of libraries for controlling ev3dev functionality from user space code.

### Need support or found a bug? Read through our [support page](http://www.ev3dev.org/support/) to find the best place to ask.

We have an IRC chat channel as well as our GitHub issues tracker that we use to discuss the ev3dev project and track remaining work. The support page explains how you can utilize these tools most effectively.
